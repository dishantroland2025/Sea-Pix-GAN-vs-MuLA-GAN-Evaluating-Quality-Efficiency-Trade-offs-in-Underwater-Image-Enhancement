# Underwater GAN Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the official implementation accompanying the manuscript:

**“Comparative Analysis of GAN Architectures for Enhanced Underwater Image Quality and Efficiency”**

The work presents a comparative study of two GAN-based underwater image enhancement methods:
- **Sea-Pix-GAN**
- **MuLA-GAN**

The repository is intended to support **transparency, reproducibility, and further research**, in line with the policies of *The Visual Computer* journal.

## Models Implemented
- **Sea-Pix-GAN**  
  Wide U-Net–based architecture with high-weight L1 loss.
- **MuLA-GAN**  
  Narrow attention-based U-Net architecture with VGG perceptual loss.

Both models are implemented and evaluated under identical experimental conditions.
